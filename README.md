# Ch13NeuralNetworks
This analysis focused on identifying worthy venture capital investments using deep learning through TensorFlow and Keras. A basic neural network model using a standard hidden layer formula and the ReLU activation function was assessed, followed by two additional models. There was not a significant difference in the accuracy between these three models. The second model used twice the number of hidden layers as the first, but all other parameters were kept the same. The third model used a Leaky ReLU activiation function, but kept all other parameters the same as the first model. Other potential areas of invstigation for improvement could be different activation functions combined with additional hidden layers.
